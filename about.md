## A Little About Me

Before you jump into my programming skills, here's a peek into my life outside of work. I enjoy coming up with fun little rhymes and spotting connections between some words that usually don't seem to be related, can't give you any spicy example now because most of the time I do that in Georgian which I believe you don't speak my fellow reader.

I'm into a bunch of sports. I play a mean game of ping-pong and foosball, love snowboarding and I'm the undisputed king of riverbank rock-hopping (it's a niche sport with me as the only one practicioner). I'm a collector of epic board games and the Game Master of countless play nights. As the founder of an organization 'The men belong to the kitchen' I myself like to cook. I also like exploring exotic dishes from my travels around Georgia and beyond.

I'm socially active, I often go to bars, festivals having boardgame nights... During my quiet time time I watch TV shows, movies, animes, cartoons... I also have  a parallel life on Reddit like every other regular redditor.

## And a little about me as a software engineer

Iâ€™m a senior software engineer with 8 years of hands-on experience across diverse software projects. I specialize in Java (Java 7/8/11/17/21) and related technologies, and I've worked extensively in industries like Banking (2.5 years), Crypto (1.5 years), AdTech (2.5 years), and Ticket Marketplaces (1.5 years and ongoing).

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked with both monolithic and microservice architectures. I have experience building both synchronous and asynchronous systems, developing highly concurrent and multithreaded applications, and optimizing high-throughput systems â€” including one handling over 400,000 requests per second. Iâ€™ve worked on numerous optimization tasks and have strong experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases.

I'm highly responsible and take pride in simplifying complex flows by breaking them down into understandable, actionable parts. I have consistently worked in Agile environments and am very comfortable with that methodology. Additionally, Iâ€™ve conducted interviews for various companies and projects, contributing to technical hiring and team growth.

## Employment

### Ticket Marketplace  
**Role**: Senior Software Engineer  
**Duration**: November 2024 - Present  
**Technologies**: Java 21, Spring Boot, GCP, Kafka, Postgresql, OpenApi, DDD  

The project is a ticket marketplace (a place where users can buy tickets for different events). It collects inventory for many different events and categorizes them, allowing users to easily search and filter. The platform also integrates with multiple aggregators (partners who provide us with tickets), enables users to buy or sell tickets, and handles delivery in the case of physical tickets. The project is written in microservices. My teamâ€™s role is to rewrite the module responsible for collecting tickets from different aggregators and to ensure that all inventory is up to date. My role on the project is to design and implement the new architecture.

### Ad Server
- **Role**: Senior Software Engineer

A state-of-the-art cryptocurrency trading platform that integrated over ten major crypto exchanges, offering users the ability to synchronize with their exchange funds, design trading bots, and automate their trading strategies. My role encompassed sprint planning, task estimation, research, performance optimization, and bot development. I created a framework that streamlined bot implementation, leading to a significant reduction in development time.

### SSO for Bank of Georgia
